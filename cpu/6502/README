The cpu/6502/ directory is used for targeting 6502-based machines using the cc65
compiler (http://www.cc65.org/). In almost all cases it is preferable to go for
a recent snapshot instead of the latest official version. The most recent cc65
snapshot is available at: ftp://ftp.musoftware.de/pub/uz/cc65/snapshot/.

The Contiki network configuration for 6502-based targets is loaded from a binary
configuration file (by default named contiki.cfg). It has the following format:
- Bytes  1 -  4: IP Address     (HiByte first)
- Bytes  5 -  8: Subnet Mask    (HiByte first)
- Bytes  9 - 12: Default Router (HiByte first)
- Bytes 13 - 16: DNS Server     (HiByte first)
- Bytes 17 - 18: Ethernet card I/O address (LoByte first !)
- Bytes 19 - xx: Ethernet card driver name (ASCII / PETSCII)
