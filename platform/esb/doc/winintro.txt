\section winintro-intro Introduction

This is a brief introduction to Contik/ESB programming under Windows
using cygwin and some other free software tools.

\section winintro-installing Installing the development environment

This sections describes how to install all the necessary software
to get started with ESB programming.

\subsection winintro-installing-cygwin Cygwin - a Linux-like environment for Windows

The first "need to have" software is the cygwin environment that can
be found at http://www.cygwin.com. Click on the icon "Install
Cygwin Now" to the right to get the installation started.

Choose "Install from Internet" and then specify where you want to
install cygwin (recommended installation path:
<tt>C:\\cygwin</tt>). Continue with the installation until you are
asked to select packages. Most packages can be left as "Default" but
there is one package that are not installed by default. Install the
following package by clicking at "Default" until it changes to
"Install":

- Devel - contains things for developers (make, etc).

When cygwin is installed there should be a cygwin icon that starts
up a cygwin bash when clicked on. Whenever it is time to compile and
send programs to the ESB nodes it will be done from a cygwin shell.

\subsection winintro-installing-editor C programming editor

If you do not already have a nice programming editor it is a good
idea to download and install one. The Crimson editor is a nice
windows based editor that is both easy to get started with and
fairly powerful.

Crimson Editor can be found at:
http://www.crimsoneditor.com/

The editor is useful both when editing C programs and when
modifying scripts and configuration files.

\subsection winintro-installing-compiler MSP430 Compiler and tools

A compiler is needed to compile the programs to the MSP430
microprocessor that is used on the ESB sensor nodes. Download and
install the GCC toolchain for MSP430 (recommended installation path:
C:\\MSP430\\).

The GCC toolchain for MSP430 can be found at:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/mspgcc/

When the above software is installed you also need to set-up the
PATH so that all of the necessary tools can be reached. In cygwin
this is done by the following line (given that you have installed
at recommended locations):

<tt>
export PATH=\$PATH:/cygdrive/c/MSP430/mspgcc/bin
</tt>

This line can also be added to the .profile startup file in your cygwin
home directory
(<tt>C:\\cygwin\\home\\\<YOUR USERNAME\>\\.profile</tt>).

If your home directory is located elsewhere you can find it by
starting cygwin and running \c cd followed by \c pwd.

\subsection winintro-installing-contiki The Contiki operating system, including examples

When programming the ESB sensor nodes it is very useful to have an
operating system that takes care of some of the low-level tasks and
also gives you as a programmer APIs for things like events, hardware
and networking.  We will use the Contiki operating system developed by
Adam Dunkels, SICS, which is very well suited when programming small
embedded systems.

The Contiki OS can be found at:
http://www.sics.se/~adam/contiki/

Unzip the Contiki OS at (for example) C:\\
and you will get the following directories among others:

- contiki-2.x/core - the contiki operating system
- contiki-2.x/platform/esb - the contiki operating system drivers, etc for the ESB
- contiki-2.x/platform/esb/apps/ - example applications for the ESB

\section winintro-testing Testing the tools

Now everything necessary to start developing Contiki-based sensor net
applications should be installed. Start cygwin and change to the
directory <tt>contiki-2.x/platform/esb/</tt>. Then call <tt>make
beeper.co</tt>.

If you get an error about multiple cygwin dlls when compiling, you
need to delete <tt>cygwin1.dll</tt> from the MSP430 GCC toolchain
(<tt>C:\\MSP430\\bin\\cygwin1.dll</tt>).

Connect a node and turn it on. Upload the test application by calling
<tt>make beeper.u</tt>.

\subsection winintro-testing-development Development tools

- <tt>make \<SPEC\></tt> will compile and make a executable file ready
for sending to the ESB nodes. Depending on the \c SPEC it might even
startup the application that sends the executable to the
node. Typically you would write things like <tt>"make beeper.u"</tt>
to get the file <tt>beeper.c</tt> compiled, linked and sent out to the
ESB node

\subsection winintro-testing-shell Some basic shell commands

- <tt> cd \<DIR\></tt> change to a specified directory (same as in DOS)
- <tt> pwd \<DIR\></tt> shows your current directory
- <tt> ls</tt> list the directory
- <tt> mkdir \<DIR\></tt> creates a new directory
- <tt> cp \<SRC\> \<DEST\></tt> copies a file
