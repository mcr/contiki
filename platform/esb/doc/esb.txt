\defgroup esb The ESB Embedded Sensor Board

The ESB (Embedded Sensor Board) is a prototype wireless sensor network
device developed at Freie Universität Berlin.

<img src="img/esb/esb.jpg" align="right">

The ESB consists of a Texas Instruments MSP430 low-power
microcontroller with 2k RAM and 60k flash ROM, a TR1001 radio
transceiver, a 32k serial EEPROM, an RS232 port, a JTAG port, a
beeper, and a number of sensors (passive IR, active IR
sender/receiver, vibration/tilt, microphone, temperature).


The Contiki/ESB port contains drivers for most of the sensors. The
drivers were mostly adapted from sources from FU Berlin.
