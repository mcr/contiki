It is possible to run an entire Contiki system as a program under
Microsoft Windows.

\note Network I/O does not work yet.

The Microsoft Windows port of Contiki is built using the Microsoft
Visual C++ compiler which is available for free from Microsoft's web
page (registration required though).   Follow the instructions on the
link below carefully:
http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/usingpsdk/default.aspx

If you intend to around play with network I/O, get Ethereal:
- It's a great free network analyzer.
- It uses (and therefore installs) WinPcap that is used by Contiki network I/O
too.

Doubleclicking contiki-2.x\\platform\\win32\\contiki.sln should bring up the
IDE and load the Contiki 'solution'. This takes some time if done for the
first time as the source is scanned and quite some meta data gets
generated.

Select 'Build' and then 'Run' from the menu. (Or 'Build solution' from
the 'Build' menu and press F5 to run/debug the program.) This should
bring up Contiki inside a new command prompt window.

Depending on your settings for command prompt windows the mouse
should work right away with Contiki.

Resizing the command prompt window running Contiki is handled by
Contiki.

Beside the Contiki Quit menu entry you can safely use Ctrl-C for a clean
exit. You'll notice that when running Contiki from an open command
prompt window (that therefore doesn't close on Contiki exit): The caption,
colors, cursor, ... are restored.
