The platform/apple2enh/ directory is used for targeting an Enhanced Apple //e
(or compatible) computer. Most things are shared between the 6502-based targets
so please consult cpu/6502/README for further details.

The following Apple II Ethernet cards are supported:
- Uther:   Use driver cs8900a.eth  with the address $C0x0 (x = 8 + slot number).
- LANceGS: Use driver lan91c96.eth with the address $C0x0 (x = 8 + slot number).

In most cases it is desirable to use an emulator for the development and testing
of a Contiki application. AppleWin is especially well suited as it emulates the
Uther Ethernet card in slot 3. It is available at http://applewin.berlios.de/.
