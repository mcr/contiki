/**
 * \defgroup rimermh Best-effort multihop forwarding
 * @{
 *
 * The rmh module implements a multihop forwarding mechanism. Routes
 * must have already been setup with the route_add() function. Setting
 * up routes is done with another Rime module such as the \ref
 * routediscovery "route-discovery module".
 *
 * \section channels Channels
 *
 * The rmh module uses 1 channel.
