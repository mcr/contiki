MSPSim - ESB (MSP430) emulation support for the COOJA Simulator

Note:
This functionality is still under development and will in the future be added as a default application in COOJA.

Usage:
Add project directory "../apps/mspsim" in COOJA.
Create an MSP mote type by providing paths to three pre-compiled files:
	* IHEX-file (the actual file currently interpreted by MSPSim)
	* Firmware-file (contains debug-section with sourcecode-pointers)
	* Map-file (typically exported as contiki-esb.map at compile-time)

Example:
> make helloworld.firmware TARGET=esb && make helloworld.ihex TARGET=esb
Use the three files generated; helloworld.firmware, helloworld.ihex and contiki-esb.map.

There also exists a pre-compiled example in the tools/cooja/apps/mspsim/example folder.
Source code debugging will however not be available when using this example since it relies on the actual source code files pointed to by the debug-section in helloworld.firmware.

MSPSim source code access:
MSPSim is available as a standalone project (no need for COOJA).
It is maintained by Joakim Eriksson (joakime@sics.se) and Niclas Finne (nfi@sics.se).
