\mainpage The Contiki Operating System 2.x

\author Adam Dunkels <adam@dunkels.com>

The Contiki operating system is a highly portable, minimalistic
operating system for a variety of constrained systems ranging from
modern 8-bit microcontrollers for embedded systems to old 8-bit
homecomputers. Contiki provides a simple event driven kernel with
optional preemptive multithreading, interprocess communication using
message passing signals, a dynamic process structure and support for
loading and unloading programs, native TCP/IP support using the uIP
TCP/IP stack, and a graphical subsystem with either direct graphic
support for directly connected terminals or networked virtual display
with VNC or Telnet.

Contiki is written in the C programming language and is freely
available as open source under a BSD-style license. More information
about Contiki can be found at the Contiki home page:

\section contiki-mainpage-getting-started Getting started with Contiki

Contiki is designed to run on many different \ref platform "platforms". It is also
possible to compile and build both the Contiki system and Contiki
applications on many different development platforms. 

See \ref esb-getting-started "Getting started with Contiki for the ESB platform

\section contiki-mainpage-building Building the Contiki system and its applications

 The Contiki build system is designed to make it easy to compile
 Contiki applications for either to a hardware platform or into a
 simulation platform by simply supplying different parameters to the
 <tt>make</tt> command, without having to edit makefiles or modify
 the application code.

See \ref buildsystem 

\section contiki-mainpage-threads Multi-threading and protothreads

Contiki is based on an event-driven kernel but provides support for
both multi-threading and a lightweight stackless thread-like construct
called protothreads.

\section contiki-mainpage-lib Libraries

Contiki provides a set of convenience libraries for memory management
and linked list operations.

\sa \ref timer "Simple timer library"
\sa \ref memb "Memory block management"
\sa \ref list "Linked list library"

\section contiki-mainpage-tcpip TCP/IP support

Contiki includes the uIP TCP/IP stack (http://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/)
that provides Contiki with TCP/IP networking support. uIP provides the
protocols TCP, UDP, IP, and ARP.
